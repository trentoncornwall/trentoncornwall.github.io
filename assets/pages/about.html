        Hi there! I'm Trenton, a tinkerer by nature. Since I was kid, I've
        always been passionate about trying to figure out how things work. With
        a strong interest in computing. The first web page I wrote was a book
        report in 5th grade, presented to class on a burnt CD - the good ol'
        days. I went to University of Iowa for Informatics, after graduating, I
        couldn't stop thinking about a Computer Human Interaction (WIMP Stack)
        corse I took. I was so enveloped how so many different gears worked
        together to present something so seamless. That class made a strong
        shift in my interest from Data Science to Web Dev that I've been
        pursuing since.

        I love and encourage teamwork, learning is fundamental to any position,
        what better way than from collaboration. I’m always looking to learn
        something new, even if it doesn’t pertain to what I’m currently doing. I
        think looking at new trends, languages, and work flows only adds to your
        arsenal. Providing new ways to approach current problems. Not knowing
        something is just opportunity to learn, and helping someone fill in
        knowledge gaps is super rewarding! I tend to energize the workspace
        around me and I'm a strong communicator, and not afraid to use it
        either!

        I’ve spent the last 3 years of my professional life putting these skills
        to work fixing software and hardware problems at the user level, but now
        I’d like to use them to create the software and fix the problems
        upstream instead.
