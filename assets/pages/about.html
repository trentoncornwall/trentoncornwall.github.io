          Hi there! I'm Trenton, a tinkerer by nature. Since I was kid, I've
          always been passionate about trying to figure out how things work.
          With a strong interest in computing. The first web page I wrote was a
          book report in 5th grade, presented to class on a burnt CD - the good
          ol' days. I went to University of Iowa for Informatics, after
          graduating, I couldn't stop thinking about a Computer Human
          Interaction (WIMP Stack) corse I took. I was so enveloped how so many
          different gears worked together to present something so seamless. That
          class made a strong shift in my interest from Data Science to Web Dev
          that I've been pursuing since.

          I love and encourage teamwork, learning is fundamental to any
          position, what better way than from collaboration. I’m always looking
          to learn something new, even if it doesn’t pertain to what I’m
          currently doing. I think looking at new trends, languages, and work
          flows only adds to your arsenal. Providing new ways to approach
          current problems. Not knowing something is just opportunity to learn,
          and helping someone fill in knowledge gaps is super rewarding! I tend
          to energize the workspace around me and I'm a strong communicator, and
          not afraid to use it either!

          I’ve spent the last 3 years of my professional life putting these
          skills to work fixing software and hardware problems at the user
          level, but now I’d like to use them to create the software and fix the
          problems upstream instead.
