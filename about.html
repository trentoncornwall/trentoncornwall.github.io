        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <div class="textblock">
          Hi there! I'm Trenton, a tinkerer by nature. Since I was kid, I've
          always been passionate about trying to figure out how things work.
          With a strong interest in computing - My first site was a book report
          in 5th grade, presented to class on a burnt CD - the good ol' days! I
          went to University of Iowa for Informatics, after graduating, I
          couldn't stop thinking about a Computer Human Interaction (WIMP Stack)
          course I took. I was so enveloped by how so many different gears
          worked together to present something so seamless. That class made a
          strong shift in my interest from Data Science to Web Dev which I've
          been pursuing since.

          I’ve spent the last 3 years of my professional life putting these
          skills to work fixing software and hardware problems at the user
          level, but now I’d like to use them to create the software and fix the
          problems upstream instead.
        </div>
        <div class="textblock">
          I love and encourage teamwork, learning is so fundamental to any
          position, what better way than from collaboration. I tend to energize
          the workspace around me and communicating is one of my greatest
          strenghts! I’m always seeking to learn something new, even if it
          doesn’t pertain to what I’m currently doing. Looking at new trends,
          languages, and work flows only adds to your arsenal. Providing new
          ways to approach current problems.
